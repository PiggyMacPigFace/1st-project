                        <h4>Introduction</h4>
                        <p>
                           When the Romans left after 500 years the Picts and Scots penetrated England’s power whilst the Angles, Saxons and Jutes raided the coast. The Britons sent a letter to Rome filled with all their troubles and named it 'The Groans of the Britons’. When the Romans didn't answer Prince Vortigern hit on a history changing plan. He made a treaty of friendship to the Saxon Chiefs - Hengist and Horsa, there job was to chase the invaders away, and that's what they did. These two Chiefs pursued the Picts and Scots back to their countries. To keep the peace Prince Vortigern married Rowena daughter of Hengist, but eventually he died.
The problem with the 'great idea' of Prince Vortigen was that Saxons, and the Angles, with the jutes too, kept pouring into England. They fought, and pushed the Britons back, all the way to the far west of the British Isles. The Anglo - Saxons as they are called now, didn't rest until there were 7 Saxon kingdoms and the Britons retreated into Wales, Devon and Cornwall.
And after many generations of Saxon kings of Wessex Egbert was finally crowned King over England.
 <br>
 <h4 class="text-secondary mb-0">Kings of Wessex</h4>
 <br>
 <h5><b>Egbert: 802-839</b></h5>
<p1>Was one of the first kings of Kent and Wessex. He fought and won against the King of Mercia at Ellendun in 825 and named his kingdom England. But he still had time to fight the Vikings.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<h5><b>Æthelwulf: 839-858</b></h5>
<p1>When he succeeded Egbert he gave a sub-kingdom of Kent to his younger brother Æthelstan. Soon afterwards his health declined so he went to Rome with one of his sons- Alfred, who was later to bo known as 'Alfred the Great' when he came back his eldest son Æthelbald was in revolt. (Æthelstan had died in 850)</p1>
<br>
<br>
<h5><b>Æthelbald: 858-860</b></h5>
<p1>He shared power in 856, after Æthelstan had died, but was officially king in 858.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<h5><b>Æthelbert: 860-866</b></h5>
<p1>He was king of Kent in 853 when his father went on a pilgrimage to Rome. Whilst his older brother was king of Wessex. But when Æthelwulf came back Æthelbert gave up his position, but in 860 he was king of Kent again and Wessex.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<h5><b>Æthelred I: 866-871</b></h5>
<p1>He was the first king to fight major battles against the Vikings, his younger brother - Alfred, helped to preserve the kingdom. But when they retreated to Merton, Æthelred died. And left Alfred to fight on his own.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<h5><b>Alfred the Great: 871-899</b></h5>
<p1>For the first year of his reign he fought nine battles and found some time for himself. For the next few years Alfred continued to hold his ground, but in January 878 the Vikings completely overran Wessex. Over the next four months he organized bands of people to disturb the Vikings whilst he hid in the marshes of Somerset.
Alfred somehow mustered up an army and defeated king Guthrum at Edington. Guthram made peace with Alfred, by getting baptised and becoming a christian, but Alfred fortified a chain of towns in Wessex because he didn’t trust them.
Later on in his reign Alfred made the first Saxon boats to intercept the Viking longboats. Early sea battles included archers raining arrows onto enemy ships. Warriors on the ships tried to get onto opposing boats and capture them, sometimes larger ships would ram the other boats and crush them. After he had done all this Alfred improved the education in England and at 38 he became the first king to be a scholar.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<h4 class="text-secondary mb-0">Kings of England</h4>
<br>
<h5><b>Edward: 899-925</b></h5>
<p1>Edward had a peaceful reign,he made England more powerful and sturdy. He re-conquered the East Midlands and South-East England all because his sister married the  king of Mercia. He had 18 children and they married Royals all over Europe, one even married Otto - the Holy Roman Emperor.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<h5><b>Athelstan: 925-940</b></h5>
<p1>Aethelstan was called Emperor of Britain, at Brunanburh in 937 in Northumbria. He defeated an attack by the kings of Scotland. Edmund,who was Athelstan’s brother, was his second-in-command and later his successor when Edmund’s nephews died in the battle.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<h5><b>Edmund:940-946</b></h5>
<p1>Edmund was a young, commanding General when he became king, but 6 years later he was celebrating the feast of Augustine when Leolf the Robber stabbed and assassinated him.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<h5><b>Eadred:946-955 </b></h5>
<p1>His armies fought against numerous Vikings and from time to time he won. But after reigning for 9 years he passed away.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<h5><b>Edwy:955-959</b></h5>
<p1>Edwy was a weak youth, he benefited from his Uncle’s power. At his coronation, Edwy received a submission message from the Danes, when Edwy died people were glad because he and his Government would not have survived much longer.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<h5><b>Edward:975-978</b></h5>
<p1>When Edgar was 14, he rebelled against his elder brother 2 years before he was crowned king. In the rebellion he conquered Mercia. Edgar lived as he pleased because there were not many bishops to order him to do things, also he was the last strong, Saxon leader to rule England.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<h5><b>Edward:975-978</b></h5>
<p1>When Edgar died Æthelred questioned Edward’s power, (Æthelred was only 7 at the time, so really it was his supporters who wanted a change of leader). It was the year 978 and Edward was going to see Æthelred, his host acted out a warm welcome but they secretly killed him.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<h5><b>Æthelred II:978-1013</b> <i>(also known as Æthelred the unready)</i></h5>
<p1>Æthelred was 10 when he became king, as he only became king at the age of 10, he wasn't naturally a strong leader, and was often used often. This was due to the fact that many of his advisors were untrustworthy and deceitful. This was a real problem for England at that time, as strength and unity was that only things that could stop the Danes from their conquest of England. The only way Æthelred could tame the Vikings, was by paying them lare amounts of money at a time to keep them back. The problem with this, is that it didn't get rid of them permanently, and it was very expensive. In 1013 Sweyn did start his conquest of England in 1030 and when it was obvious that Sweyn would be victorious, Æthelred promptly fled to his wife's homeland, Normandy. All his family went with him including, Emma of Normandy - his wife, Edmund, his eldest son and Edward, his third oldest son.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<h5><b>The Life of 'Emma of Normandy':984-1052</b></h5>
<p1>Emma of Normandy, was born in a noble family, her father was Richard the fearless. She married the English King, Æthelred II and became his second wife when she was 18. She was Queen of England for most of her marriage with Æthelred, apart from when Sweyn started his short-lived conquest. When Sweyn died, and Cnut - Sweyn’s son, returned to Denmark there were a couple of claims to the throne, the first, and the most obvious, was the King - Æthelred, who didn’t actually abdicate, so he was still officially king. The next claim was from Edmund, Æthelred’s eldest son with his first wife. The third comes from Emma’s eldest son, Edward (later to be known as ‘Edward the Confessor’), this claim was backed up by the king’s chief advisor. But Edmund strongly resisted and so that claim turned to nothing. Nobody still knew who would be the next king, until Æthelred died. So, Edmund became the king. After Edmund had been murdered, Cnut strategically married Emma, and became a Christian. It is said that they learnt to love each other and became affectionate towards each other, even though Cnut exiled her two sons. Emma also bore one son and one daughter for Cnut.  Their names were Harthacnut and Gunhilda.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<h5><b>Sweyn:1013-1014</b></h5>
<p1>Sweyn was a king of Denmark who sent his Earls to invade England and to harass it. After getting large amounts of money in 1012, the Earls killed the Archbishop of Canterbury Cathedral. A year later Sweyn commanded his fleets to occupy England, which they did. But when he pursued the last of the Saxons his horse tripped and killed him, he was only king of England for five weeks.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<h5><b>Edmund II:1016</b> <i>(known as Edmund Ironside)</i></h5>
<p1>After the sudden death of Sweyn, Cnut, Sweyn’s son, retired back to Denmark, So Edmund seized the throne until…</p1>
<br>
<br>
<h5><b>Cnut:1016-1035</b></h5>
<p1>When Sweyn died Cnut went back to Denmark, but only a year later he returned. Cnut was not meek or mild - he is supposed to have murdered Edmund, but it is not for sure. His two brothers were sent to exile. He married Edmund’s mother, Emma, and neglected his first wife - Aelfgifu and her children. He ruled very well, Cnut was just, and he was fairly tolerant with those who disobeyed. But he ruled with strength and fear, as well. Cnut also introduced dividing the Kingdom up into smaller sections for other people to govern. When he was older Cnut proclaimed Harthacnut as his heir, but Harold, from his first wife, was determined to take the throne.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<h5><b>Harold I:1035-1040</b></h5>
<p1>Cnut’s problem was that he couldn’t prevent Harold taking Harthacnut’s title as King, and this is exactly what happened. When Harthacnut hurried to Denmark, he appointed Harold as a part time ruler. But, backed by Earl Godwin, Harold took the throne, Harthacnut ignored this move - probably he was too wrapped up with his war against Magnus king of Norway. When Emma of Normandy’s two sons came to visit her, Harthacnut promised them safe passage. But as he wasn’t there, Harold, and his supporters seized the chance to get rid of a couple more claims to the throne. They captured Edward’s younger brother, Alfred, and killed him but, unfortunately for Harold, Edward managed to escape back to Normandy. Harold's death is uncertain.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<h5><b>Harthacnut:1040-1042</b></h5>
<p1>With trouble brewing in up north, Harthacnut rushed back to Denmark trying to subdue Magnus, king of Norway, who was disputing over some land. Harthacnut let Harold govern most of England for him, except Wessex, this he gave to his Mother - Emma, while he went to Denmark. The war went longer than he expected, and the English soon accepted Harold as their king. In the end Harthacnut made an agreement with Magnus. It stated that whoever died without a heir wouldn’t have the land. Harthacnut rushed back to England in 1040, and made Edward his heir. Unexpectantly, in 1042 Harthacnut collapsed at a wedding banquet and died immediately.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<h5><b>Edward:1042-1066</b></h5>
<p1>Edward was in exile as a 12 year old prince, but was brought back by Harthacnut when he was middle aged - we don't know the exact age he was when Edward ascended to the throne. For most of his rule Edmund was forced to consent to his father - in - law’s advice, His father - in - law was Earl Godwin, this is partly because he had already murdered Edward’s brother, Alfred. (This is controversial though, as some say Harold the I did the murder, not wanting too many claims to the throne.) But what we do know is that they were both on the same side, so maybe they both murdered Alfred. In Edward the Confessor’s reign, he, as you would have already heard, had to submit to his father - in - law’s help. Godwin, Edward’s father - in - law, was trying to produce a heir after Edward, this became a success, and a heir was produced, Harold Godwinson. Unexpectantly, Edward banished the whole family of Earl Godwin. He then proclaimed his cousin, William of Normandy, his heir. It is believed that this was a stroke of prematurity on Edward’s part. Later, he regretted his decision, so he changed his mind and made Harold his heir. Edward also called back the son of Edmund Ironside. His name was Edward the exile, he had been in exile for 40 years. As he was coming to England from Hungary Edward the exile died in suspicious circumstances. Edward Exile's son, Edgar Ætheling had a right to the throne as well, but as he was only in his late teens, he was considered too young to rule. But there was yet another person wanting to be king of England after Edward the Confessor, this time it was the king of Norway, Harold Hardrada, although he was a predecessor of Magnus, because of this he some how felt he had the right to become the king of England, and Harold made sure everyone knew he wanted to become king when Harold succeeded Edward. When Earl Godwin died, much of his role fell to his son - Harold Godwinson, a friendship also develop between Edward the Confessor and Harold, even though he was exiled as a child. Edward is credited with building Westminster Abbey, it had a European design to it, This is because when he was exiled as a young boy to Normandy, he would have known all the Normandish buildings and their architecture, so he built it like the ones he saw as a boy in Europe. Edward died a week after Westminster Abbey was dedicated.
</p1>
<br>
<br>
<h5><b>The life of 'Tostig':1026-1066</b></h5>
<p1>When Tostig was young he was exiled along with his family, including his brother, Harold, by king Edward. But the next year the family returned with armed forces, determined for the king to recognise their nobility. Edward apparently did, as Tostig became the Earl of Northumbria. Unfortunately for the people in Northumbria, Tostig wasn’t a good leader, he was ruthless and merciless - it was fatal if anyone disagreed with him. With some members of important families assassinated and being ruled by a hand of iron, the people had had enough, and his popularity plummeted in 1063. Finally, in 1065 the thanes of Northumbria - thanes were the third class after the king, and the Earls - captured the city of York, and killed Tostig’s officials. Then they marched down to the south to share their complaint to the king. As they marched down people joined them in agreement, even Earl Edwin and his army met and joined the march south. In the south they were met by Earl Harold Godwinson who had come to negotiate with them on the king’s behalf. After speaking to the rebels, Harold had to agree with them, even though Tostig was his brother. Harold then persuaded Edward that the rebels were right. Just a while later, Tostig was made an outlaw. But Tostig didn’t accept the punishment given to him, and publicly accused Harold of starting the rebellion. Unsurprisingly, Harold immediately had his brother exiled. Tostig went to Normandy where he planned to support William of Normandy, but this didn’t work, to the dismay of Tostig. Then his brother - in - law (Baldwin)  gave him a fleet of ships, this meant that Tostig sailed to the Isle of Wight and raided the English coast all the way to Sandwich. But he was then beaten back to the coast by Harold, who had now become king. Tostig then went all round the English coast causing trouble, but after a couple of decisive wins against him, Tostig’s men deserted him. After spending a summer with his friend - Malcolm III of Scotland, Tostig persuaded Harald of Hardrada of Norway to invade England, knowing that he wanted to become king. Together with Harald, they marched through York, after it surrendered to them, and caused havoc in the north. When the news that His brother and Harald Hardrada was rampaging in the north came to Harold, he immediately gathered his army and went up to the north. Harold Godwinson surprised Tostig at Stamford Bridge, in this surprise attack many of the six thousand foot soldiers that Tostig had hired were killed, this was because the hired soldiers were badly equipped, with very little armour. The fighting at Stamford was fierce, but as Harold had the advantage of the surprise attack he began to win, and before the day was over Harold was victorious and king Harald along with his brother lay slay, although more support arrived later in the battle for Harald and his army. Later Tostig was carried to York, and was buried in the Cathedral.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<h5><b>Harold:1066</b></h5>
<p1>The Earls of England hurriedly crowned Harold king, the day after Edward the Confessor died. As soon as William of Normandy and Harald Hardrada heard that Harold had become king, both men gathered up an army, determined to get the English throne. William planned his attack to be in August, but due to bad weather it had to be postponed to September. So Harald made the first move. After being persuaded by Harold’s brother to invade England. Harald, with a fleet of 300 ships, sailed down from Norway and landed in the north of England where Tostig met him. Harald’s fleet sailed up the river Ouse, after collecting more men from Orkney and Scotland. Tostig had recruited the men from Scotland, and played an important role for Harald. Tostig Godwinson and former Earl of Northumbria, was the brother of Harold, but after disputing with him in 1065 he was stripped of his title, and he was exiled as well. When Tostig and Harald invaded England, Harold Godwinson raced to the north of England and won a decisive victory over the Norwegian king, which included the death of Tostig and Harald Hardrada, the king himself. As the winning army celebrated their victory, news of a vast fleet of William’s had landed in the south of England, yet again, the troops raced back through England and the now exhausted army finally arrived near Hastings. It is believed that William had the stronger army. The first reason is the fact that William’s troops were better - with a wider range of soldiers he was capable of changing to different styles of the attack, William had calvary, archers, and foot soldiers. Whilst Harold only had ‘fyrd’ these weren’t proper soldiers, they were people who were called to fight when necessary, but carried on with their normal lives most of the time, most of them didn’t even have any proper equipment. Then Harold Godwinson had the professional soldiers, they were called ‘housecarls’ these soldiers were experienced and well trained with good weapons. Probably the main difference between these two armies was that William’s army were well rested and lively - nearly the opposite of Harold’s army, they were battle - worn and tired after the struggle at Stamford and then the long march through England. So, at 9am on 14 October 1066 the two armies met, William at the bottom of Senlac hill and Harold at the top. For most of the battle Harold’s shield wall stopped the unwavering charge from Williams calvary, a shield wall consists of shields interlocking with each other to form a barrier, with spears and axes sticking out. With his plan not working, William switched tactics, with part of his army staging a retreat, the anglo saxons raced after them down the hill. But at the bottom of the hill they were ambushed and the Normans turned round and split up the ranks. With the shield wall gone, Harold’s men were helpless and by the time the day was over Harold lay slain, and the English army was defeated.</p1>
